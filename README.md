#### Description

Siletha is a fantasy RPG, inspired heavily by games such as World of Warcraft, The Witcher Franchise, and The Elder Scrolls Franchise.

#### Story

The world of Acirhia was not always the peaceful place we all know. The Realm of Siletha is known for the peace of it's people. However, thousands of years ago, they were threatened by something more dark than anyone could imagine.
A young man, Balin of Aucruth Isles, wanted something more than his small pig farm. His great-grandfather, an unfamiliar mage, left his books behind after he passed. Balin used one of these spells, opeaning a rift to an unknown world. He believed he could use it to show the power he truly had to everyone. But in reality, he began an new Argumentation.
The Elders called it Dreovosia, a world that is unspoken. Pure Evil and terror flows through it. Once the door had opened, the unthinkable stepped through. For years, the people fought back. It wasn't untill the Von Esinefaust Clan was able to banish the Unspeakable, that the people could be at peace.
But now, the wind is colder. The nights are longer and the shadows are darker. Rumors say the Unspeakable is back to claim Acirhia as it's own. Is it time for a new hero to come out of the shadows, and save us once more
